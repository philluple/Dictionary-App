# WordChime

**WordChime** is a dictionary and rhyming tool designed to provide quick access to word definitions and rhymes. Built using the [WordsAPI](https://rapidapi.com/dpventures/api/wordsapi) from RapidAPI, the app allows users to search for word meanings and find rhyming words with ease. To enhance user experience, WordChime also caches recent searches, making repeat lookups faster and more efficient.

### Key Features

- **Word Definitions**: Instantly look up the meaning of any word.
- **Rhyming Words**: Discover words that rhyme with your search term.
- **Search Caching**: Recently searched words are stored and retrieved quickly.

### Development

This app was designed and developed solo within a week, leveraging WordsAPI for the core functionality. The focus was on creating a simple yet powerful tool for anyone needing both definitions and rhymes in one place.
